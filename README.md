# eve-mining-status

A little program that reads the game log for the characters I'm logged in with and let's me see the status of my little mining squad. If all characters are mining away happily it'll show the green LED. If someone depletes an asteroid the amber LED goes on and if anyone is under attack the red LED lights up.

Once I've seen the LED and dealt with the issue I press the red button to dismiss the notification and turn the green LED back on.

Not exactly exciting, but it does the job for now. My next little addition will be getting the little buzzer to sound for half a second whenever an LED is turned on.
